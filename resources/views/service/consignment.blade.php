    <p>Not all unwanted jewellery is ready for the scrap gold melting pot. In many cases consigning jewellery is a way for the owner to maximize their payout and not have the hassle or security risks of trying to sell an item privately.</p>

    <p>Consignment jewellery comes complete with an independent appraisal and buying consignment or “previously loved” jewellery is an excellent way for the purchaser to maximize their budget.</p>
  
    <p>Jewellery sold as consignment is not “new” jewellery and therefore the prices have been adjusted to be competitive in a secondary sales market. All consignment jewellery sold at Excel has been professionally cleaned, repaired and valued.</p>
  
    <p>Thinking of Consigning Jewellery?</p>

    <p>Bring in your unwanted jewellery to our Langley location for inspection and valuation.</p>

    <p><b>Consignment Jewellery is offered for only at Excel Jewellers Langley</b></p>
