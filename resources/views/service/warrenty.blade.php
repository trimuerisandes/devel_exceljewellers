    <h3>LIFETIME PROTECTION AGAINST LOSS</h3>
    <p>If due to a manufacturer’s defect your original diamond is lost from its original mounting, and is in the opinion of Excel Jewellers in good condition and you have brought your jewellery in for Semi-Annual Inspection. Excel Jewellers will replace your lost diamond free of charge on any one occasion, (ONCE) during the life of your jewellery. Presentation of this validated certificate is required.</p>
    <p>This Lifetime Guarantee does not cover theft, mysterious disappearance, loss or damage caused by everyday wear or act of god. We recommend that you insure your jewellery against unforeseen circumstances and consider blanket jewellery coverage on your homeowner’s policy.</p>
    <p>To maintain its validity, our Lifetime Guarantee requires a semi-annual six(6) month inspection at which time we will professionally clean your jewellery piece and check settings, free of charge. All repairs recommended as a result of these inspections must be completed by Excel Jewellers to maintain this benefit</p>

    <h3>OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU</h3>
    <p>Excel Jewellers warrants your jewellery against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for ONE (1) YEAR from your date of purchase (“Warranty Period”). If any defects are found during the Warranty Period, Excel will provide all necessary repairs free of charge. The following are not considered a defect and as such are excluded from free repairs: rhodium plating, soldering, chain soldering, special finish requests, re-casting, any lose of brilliance, and, in the case of earrings, earring back replacements due to loss. The Warranty does not cover your Excel jewellery where the defect:</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>is caused by normal wear and tear or is otherwise due to normal aging arising from use.</li>
    	<li>is attributable to repair, service, or alteration performed by anyone other than Excel.</li>
    	<li>is attributable to abuse, accident, misuse, mishandling, and contact with chemicals, fire, or</li>
    	<li>is attributable in whole or in part to use of the jewellery outside of the indented uses prescribed by Excel Jewellers.</li>
    	<li>relates to rhodium plating of white gold jewellery. White gold is rhodium plated to enhance its appearance and this plating is not permanent and will require further plating to maintain the enhanced appearance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>LIFETIME TRADE UP OPTION</h3>
    <p>At any time, your original Excel Jewellers center diamond can be fully credited towards a new diamond provided the next diamond purchase must be at least twice the price paid for the original diamond (minimum trade in value of $1000). Trade-ins cannot be accepted on a used setting or mounting.</p>
