    <p>Excel Jewellers offers premium, independent jewellery appraisals either by appointment or as a drop off service. Our independent Certified Gemologist works onsite, in our fully secured premises so you can rest easy knowing your valuables are safe.</p>

    <p>We offer appraisals for items purchased at Excel as well as your own fine jewellery or timepieces. Appraisals provide you with detailed information, images and valuation for your jewellery items. Jewellery that contains diamonds or gemstones will have detailed information sited on your appraisal.</p>
  
    <p>Appraisal valuations are instrumental in scheduling your jewellery on insurance policies and also for piece of mind. As a partner in jewellery replacement through insurance companies, Excel Jewellers recommends having your jewellery appraised every two years to ensure accurate valuation.</p>
  
    <p>For heirloom and collection appraisals, we provide ‘while you wait’ service by appointment.</p>
