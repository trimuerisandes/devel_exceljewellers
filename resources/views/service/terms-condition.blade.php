In such a case a restocking fee of 15% of the original invoice will be charged, with the remaining balance to be issued as a store credit only. </p>

            <h4>Colored Gemstone Enhancement Disclosure</h4>
            <p>Purchasers of colored gemstones should be aware that natural gemstones are processed from the time they are extracted from the earth by one or more traditionally accepted trade practices. All colored gemstones listed on the front of this sales slip have probably been subject to stable and possibly undetectable enhancement processes. All relevant information will be provided to the best of our knowledge. Prevailing market values are based on these universally practiced and accepted processes by the gem and jewelry trade</p>

        <div class="text-container">
