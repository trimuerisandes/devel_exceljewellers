    <h3><b>General Tips for protecting your jewellery:</b></h3>
    <p>Jewellery damage is very common but fortunately, protecting your jewellery is easy with proper attention and care.</p>
    <p>If you bump or catch your jewellery, come in to Excel Jewellers in Langley to have one of our GIA trained specialists inspect it immediately for missing stones or damaged prongs.</p>
    <p>Gloves commonly catch prongs on rings. Take extra care when removing them so you don’t damage or lose your engagement ring or other favorite piece.</p>
    <p>Prevent damage to your jewellery by removing it before gardening, playing sports, swimming, or performing difficult chores around your home. Place it in a safe location.</p>
    <p>Come in to our store regularly for a complimentary cleaning and inspection.</p>
